Plan for the refactoring:

- move to proper OOP incrementally
- run analysis via CDFD
- adjust extractors one after another:
    - arguments and return values in a standardized format (always services, flows, external entities, even if left unchanged)
    - add name to list of extractors in a file, these get executed
    - for that: duplicate xxx_entry.py as name.py (same as folder name), perform changes in there
    - main function must be called "detect_name" for now
